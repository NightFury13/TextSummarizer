A generation of North Korean children is already scarred for life said Astrid Heiberg president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea$0
A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua near the North Korean border said the North Koreans were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in China had formed criminal gangs or engaged in prostitution$0
And while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation he said he accepted North Korea s explanation that they had been excluded from some areas for national security reasons$0
But he notes one political tidbit North Korea s constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate to the country s people s assembly for every citizens$0
But of course they drink it they have no choice he said during a recent trip to Beijing$0
Chang said North Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the Sydney Olympics$0
Even in war torn countries famine is more in pockets Dr$0
Hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the North Korean capital Pyongyang life did seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to North Korea$0
He said they had crossed into China seeking food not because of political repression in North Korea$0
It has been a food importer for decades mostly from the former Soviet Union but also from China$0
It sent only athletes and officials to the Winter Olympics in Nagano Japan in February$0
It will be the largest sports delegation the communist country has sent abroad in recent years$0
North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said athletes from his country will compete in events in Bangkok hoping to win medals in women s judo women s soccer wrestling table tennis weightlifting and boxing$0
Past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of North Korean refugees who had fled into China$0
Police in northeastern China s Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country$0
Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged North Korea s crop production and capacity to import food in the closed communist nation$0
Swedlund said that after three years in the country the international Red Cross which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems$0
The ministry described Kim as a former athlete but said details of his background and his method of escape from North Korea were not available$0
The ministry generally uses the term third country to avoid naming China which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defectors to their homeland$0
The officials warned against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country shows little willingness to adopt far reaching changes to revive its ruined economy$0
They fought a three year war in the early s$0
They fought the Korean War in and never signed a formal peace treaty$0
This is really part of the daily life she said$0
This year s assembly did not expand as previous ones did but rather had just delegates the same as the previous assembly held in $0
To me this is a famine in slow motion$0
A lot of the children were too weak to come to school he said$1
A survey carried out in September and October also showed that percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished with a body weight too low for their height$1
About percent of children in one primary school he visited were not in class$1
Among other shocking findings researchers from the World Food Program Unicef and the European Union found that because of long term food shortages a staggering percent of children under years old suffer from stunted growth$1
And they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings Boys were twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls and every child whose mother was dead was malnourished$1
At that age malnutrition can permanently impair physical and intellectual growth said Judy Cheng Hopkins WFP director for the region$1
Boys were almost twice as badly affected as girls$1
But the totality is very hard to gauge For three weeks this fall crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children providing by far the most solid data on the crisis$1
By comparison a similar survey of North Korean children under found that percent are stunted and percent suffer from acute malnutrition$1
Cheng Hopkins said$1
Cheng Hopkins said about half of follow up inspections were now unannounced and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random$1
Children in North Korea s three largest cities Pyongyang Wonsan and Nampo were better off than their counterparts elsewhere with percent acutely malnourished$1
Eighteen teams each headed by a foreign official from the World Food Program the UN Children s Fund or the European Union carried out the study$1
In addition to finding that percent of children had stunted growth the teams found that about percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study$1
In this fall s independent nutritional survey teams of experts sent to eight of North Korea s nine provinces looked at rural and urban children under seven$1
It s hard to think of another country that s been affected in this way The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad$1
Most of those receiving WFP aid are children aged between months and years$1
Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be or years old but appeared to be only or years old$1
North Korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that percent of North Korean children under age are acutely malnourished and that percent of all children are physically stunted$1
Now at last we have hard facts the situation is very grave said Judith Cheng Hopkins regional director for Asia of the World Food Program which has taken part in the research$1
So a month ago the World Food Program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged to $1
Still there are some disturbing clues In one limited study conducted by the World Food Program and other groups last year on children hand picked by the government percent had a parent who was dead$1
The most alarming findings were for toddlers aged one to two percent of whom were acutely malnourished$1
The situation is much worse than most people recognize According to a recent WFP survey percent of Cambodian children under age are stunted by lack of food and percent suffer from acute malnutrition$1
They found that percent of children under had stunted growth a symptom of long term malnutrition$1
They measured the weight and height of North Korean children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly selected in areas where aid agencies have access$1
We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker Swedlund said$1
Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North Korean children with two thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment UN experts said Wednesday$1
Still the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily and freedom to move about has improved$10
We re still really limited in what we can see Swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different from the open ones$10
North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulties but there have been sharply diverging assessments of how serious these are$11
Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines had no glass to replace broken windows and were colder inside than out having received no coal since $12
It blamed the deaths on stress caused by the long shipment by truck to the North$13
The country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can t just be blamed on the weather anymore Ms$13
Animosity and distrust between the two Koreas run deep$14
And they were just sitting there working$15
The congressman Tony Hall D Ohio who has had a longtime interest in world hunger passed through Tokyo on his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken of North Korean children with patchy hair protruding bones open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition$15
There were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished they were so thin and they had patchy hair she said$15
In India and Bangladesh pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty while in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed$16
That figure which reflects ongoing shortages is exceeded in Asia only by Bangladesh India and Sri Lanka$16
And I really think these areas are important from that standpoint he added going through a map of closed areas and describing what Western intelligence experts know about military installations there$17
There are now more than Westerners living in Pyongyang the capital city and many say the long term hunger is readily apparent there$17
But public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal$18
I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh Dr$18
Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently$18
After three years of food donations many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better but that their older siblings are failing$19
All complained about severe food and fuel shortages in their country$19
And in any case the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements$19
Based on visits to four hospitals Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply$19
But that doesn t mean it can t exist$19
Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine Red Cross workers say leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have$19
Even if the situation improves it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw said Judit Katona Apte a senior program adviser for the World Food Program$19
Fertilizer is lacking as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery meaning most planting and harvesting must be done by hand$19
He said that even in hospitals sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps$19
He said that next year the Red Cross would start to address those problems spending on food for hospital patients and million on water treatment$19
If you saw them in a refugee camp you would recommend immediate intervention But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system that option does not exist she and others said$19
In one hospital assistants were holding down a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without electric lights or anesthesia$19
Katona Apte a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and the Sudan said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean kindergarten last year$19
Katona Apte said$19
Katona Apte said$19
More than five years of severe food shortages and a near total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired a new study by international aid groups has found$19
One bed hospital in the countryside was keeping only three patients at a time because it did not have food to care for more said Heiberg$19
People will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities Likewise when Red Cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the hospitals and clinics where they operate they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption said Sten Swedlund head of the Red Cross delegation in North Korea$19
Separately international medical workers from groups like the Red Cross have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services$19
She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages of North Korea s slow motion famine electricity supplied to only half the capital Pyongyang at a time the elderly looking swollen a sign of long term hunger a generation of children stunted with year olds looking like year olds and year olds like year olds$19
She may be but she looks just or Dr$19
So they may not be severely malnourished but they are not well nourished at all he said$19
They have discovered that despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years severe malnutrition is widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development suggesting that this generation s physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered$19
This is accepted as normal They are in school and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation$19
This means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year$19
With few goods or money to barter or buy foreign supplies the country lacks sufficient fertilizer for crops and fuel and parts for machinery$19
A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger stricken homeland government officials said$2
About North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years including so far this year$2
As the long harsh winter begins doctors confirm and official statistics show widespread malnutrition tuberculosis on the rise and hunger weakened patients unable to recover from operations and sickness Heiberg said$2
Calling the North s claim nonsense Seoul s Ministry of National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other cattle being raised at its ranch on the west coast$2
Chang made the remarks in an interview published recently by the Chosun Shinbo a newspaper run by pro North Korean residents in Japan said Seoul s Naewoe Press which obtained the report$2
Citing a North Korean human rights group and Japanese tourists visiting the region South Korea s Yonhap News Agency reported Monday that North Koreans had been sent home from China despite having presented petitions for political asylum$2
Despite catastrophic hunger at home North Korea plans to send athletes and officials to next month s Asian Games in Thailand South Korean officials said Thursday$2
Hall also brought back a bag of what officials called substitute food being distributed by a government food station dried leaves and straw so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away$2
He also rejected the notion that the North Korean military is stealing donated food a charge leveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders when it angrily pulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there$2
Heiberg likened the additives to cattle food and noted that doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures$2
Hyundai hopes to send by ship up to tourists a week for four day tours of Diamond Mountain on the North s east coast beginning in November$2
In September Doctors Without Borders announced that it was pulling its staff of from North Korea because it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected rather than to the most needy$2
Many Korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition few had seen it before this decade$2
Naewoe is run by South Korea s main government intelligence agency and specializes in monitoring communist news media$2
Ngongi said the government cited security concerns notably the lack of a peace treaty with its rival South Korea for its decision$2
North Korea claimed of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force fed them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them to the North$2
North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games in Hiroshima Japan in $2
On Thursday South Korean Unification Minister Kang In duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week saying that the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the dead cattle is cleared Kang said the North s letter cleared a stumbling block for Hyundai s additional cattle donation During his visit Chung is expected to reach agreement on details of Hyundai s plan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the North$2
One thing I ve learned is how important national security issues are to the North Koreans said Swedlund a retired admiral in the Swedish Navy$2
Still she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions$2
The Korean states were separated into the communist North and the capitalist South in $2
The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in $2
The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retracted its accusations$2
The founder of South Korea s largest conglomerate plans to visit his native North Korea again next week with a gift of cattle company officials said Thursday$2
The ministry later acknowledged that lumps of rope were found in the stomachs of some cattle on the ranch but said the material didn t kill the animals donated to North Korea$2
The official who spoke on condition of anonymity denied reports in the South Korean press that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum in forcing the refugees back across the border$2
The tours originally scheduled to begin in September have been delayed because of cost security and other matters$2
The visit has been delayed a month because of a dispute over cattle donated by Chung Ju yung founder of the Hyundai group during a trip to the North in June$2
Travel is still restricted$2
Although hard figures are not yet available the prospects for this year are that the harvest will not be any better Ngongi told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea$3
As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly often grudgingly granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six months an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies$3
But Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives$3
But in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed to visit he added the overall situation is worse than ever$3
Every year it gets worse Ngongi said$3
Famine threatened North Korea s harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse a senior UN aid official said Saturday$3
Food aid is largely being turned over to UN agencies$3
Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world said Margareta Wahlstrom the Red Cross undersecretary of disaster relief who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting the aid agency s operations in North Korea$3
It may be worse than last year Poor harvests economic collapse and three years of floods and drought have produced chronic food shortages in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid$3
It was the first technically sound survey of the problem UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters$3
Kim Myong Sup had been living in hiding in a third country since fleeing North Korea last year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said$3
North Korea has said that it will show off the complex only if Washington promises that if the complex is not a nuclear one it will pay for vilifying us and impairing our prestige Washington refuses to pay and North Korea is warning that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart$3
Now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every to months$3
Ordinary North Koreans are suffering in part because their government s hard line policies have alienated would be donors and aid agencies$3
Some visitors with the United Nations and other organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago$3
The United Nations has repeatedly appealed for relief aid for North Korea but the latest appeal has raised less than one third of the target$3
The United States has been supplying grain to North Korea but strains are growing over a secret underground complex in the North that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons program$3
The United States warned last week that the agreed framework that is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North lets American experts visit the underground complex and resolve their doubts$3
The government said the ban would be temporary Ngongi added$3
The majority of Cambodian farmers are not producing enough to keep their families fed and are being increasingly saddled with debts incurred when they run out of reserves before harvest Davies said$3
The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North Korea Davies said$3
The researchers said that available scientific data suggest that years ago malnutrition was rare in North Korea$3
The study the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country$3
Their shameless and wicked demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affairs declared North Korea s leading newspaper Rodong Sinmun$3
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years$4
A lot of people are alive today thanks to the international community s support he said$4
And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal the future of a generation irretrievably lost$4
But despite the need for food aid Ngongi said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to which the WFP has access from to reducing the number of people who can get aid from million to million$4
Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter may take a toll on the weakened population she said$4
Everywhere from bakeries to government ministries people were being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans mixed with acorns grass and herbs Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said$4
Hall said he thought that overall at least million people had died and that the total was probably closer to million$4
In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation the US Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting that North Korea s population peaked in at million and has since fallen to million this year$4
It s becoming a regular part of the food basket Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating this partly indigestible material he said but added If you re very hungry it fills your stomach Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid s the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union which had long been North Korea s main supplier of food fuel and fertilizer$4
Ngongi who spent four days inspecting WFP relief efforts in North Korea said people generally looked better than during a visit last year$4
Nicholas Eberstadt an American specialist on North Korean population figures says that there simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine$4
None of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger related deaths and the North Koreans have not released relevant figures although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began$4
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages having harvested only million tons of grain this year about two thirds of the minimum needed by its million people$4
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illnesses senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday$4
North Korea needs a minimum million to million tons of grain to feed its million people but managed last year to harvest just million tons Namanga Ngongi deputy head of the World Food Program said$4
That would be a decline of over three years a period when North Korea s population would have been expected to grow by about people based on the population growth rate of the early s$4
The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage the winter s main vegetable$4
The Red Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs million appeal on getting essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea$4
The grain harvest is finished and by UN estimates little improved over last year s about million tons only enough to meet two thirds of the needs of North Korea s million people$4
The noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible leaving people holding their aching stomachs he said$4
The problem is that people are too poor to access it$4
Three years of floods and drought that started in devastated North Korea s collective farming and planned economy forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed its million people$4
US officials who toured some of the hardest hit regions of North Korea this summer said million people may have died because of famine$4
While Eberstadt counsels caution that could mean that North Korea s population after eight years in which it had been expected to add several million people is now back to million people or fewer$4
With few other options vast numbers of North Koreans have resorted to eating substitute food hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants like soybeans and sweet potatoes combined with indigestible filler like cornstalks and straw$4
You would not give them to your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning Three years of floods and drought that started in devastated North Korea s collective farming and planned economy already teetering from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners$4
A budget draft proposed a reduction of the health ministry s allotment which caused an outcry in September from health officials and the UN World Health Program$5
Actual disbursements to the three ministries are often only to percent of the budgeted amount as annual revenues fall short of expectations according to aid workers$5
But he also said he could see that a large part of the population is very weak Everybody has been consuming at a very low level$5
Cambodia has produced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects another this year but WFP statistics show that percent of rice growing areas account for percent of the surplus$5
Cambodia typically earmarks about half of its annual budget to defense and security$5
Davies urged the new government to substantially increase annual expenditures on health education and rural development as a first step in a long term solution to Cambodia s food crisis$5
Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea a UN World Food Program representative said Tuesday$5
In the budget education was allocated percent health percent and rural development percent$5
Money lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge percent interest which must be paid in rice at harvest time giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next crop season$5
North Korea is a mountainous country with less than percent arable land$5
Poor sanitation lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rearing problems left mostly unaddressed by under funded health and education sectors in Cambodia have exacerbated the food security problem Davies said$5
That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and puts North Korea among the world s worst countries in terms of malnutrition$5
The WFP is currently supporting million hungry Cambodians about percent of the population with food for work and direct assistance programs but Davies said he fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to eat every day$5
The draft was later readjusted to provide an unprecedented percent increase in health spending$5
The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with the malnutrition of children is a crisis Davies said$5
The problem is poverty Davies said$5
There are more than counties home to percent of the population to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies$5
There is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that s in very bad shape Virtually all the children under who are malnourished also have diarrhea he said$5
There is enough rice$5
Thirty percent of year olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition$5
This now constitutes percent of food intake Swedlund said$5
Those areas cover around percent of the population$5
Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children said Ken Davies the WFP s country director$5
While that percent figure is not quite as bad as that of India and Bangladesh the worst in the world with an percent malnutrition rate experts say that North Korea s number in some ways understates the problem$5
People cope year after year and probably a lot drop off$6
If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is you are usually off by three years Swedlund said$7
They grind it into powder and make it into noodles Hall said$8
We need to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe $9
