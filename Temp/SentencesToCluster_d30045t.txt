They have been downsized cut back and re engineered
So when the or so remaining blue collar workers here at Mobil s largest domestic refinery out of about a decade ago heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow
I think it s a terrible thing said Dick Mabry a refinery operator as he emerged in the plant s artificial twilight from the main gate after his hour shift ended at on Sunday morning
He stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed
It s a revival of the Standard Oil Company
It s going to put or thousand people out of work
I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it Ernest Lewis whose overalls bore a Big E patch appropriate to his scale added his uh huh s
The latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby he said glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery s generators
But if the Mobil Corp
has to be sold Lewis said noting the gains in his company stock holdings a buyer as solid and large as the Exxon Corp
might be the least of all evils
If we merged with Chevron we d be Moron he added
A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries in petroleum as much as any
Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant s brick headquarters that they say shows they have already handled million barrels out of million planned for the full year
But the numbers that matter even more are the ones like even on nearby gas stations the lowest prices after inflation since the Depression
Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world s largest oil company
Some people close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered by their boards until at least Tuesday maybe Wednesday
And that is why beginning last Wednesday evening the phone at the home of Jimmy Herrington the president of the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Local rang without stop
No he didn t know about that merger talk on television said Herrington who also works full time producing lubricants
He had asked some Mobil managers in a meeting earlier this month about all the rumors but they said they had heard nothing
Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company s efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals like geologists and engineers in the field
One company s accountants could almost do the work for two
But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline motor oil and other products with even fewer people
Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery
Antitrust regulators they say are bound to notice that Exxon has refineries an hour s drive in one direction and three hours in the other along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical industry s home
The Beaumont plant a steaming humming chemistry set lining the Neches River off the Gulf has become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher
With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to hours or more workers regularly make or a year
People go there to retire there Herrington said as he drove around the plant s fenced periphery
Lewis in his th year is a third generation employee
But his nephew laboring here too is the exception
The workers streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray a sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them
The cutbacks have so far come through attrition with retirements often encouraged by incentives
But the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around Herrington s union hall advertise that the best times are long gone
His members chafe at the experts who come in from Wall Street to question the justification for every person s job
In tiring and dangerous tasks they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime although some like the extra pay and they say the plant has become safer over the years 
They complain about the growing numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks
But with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement savings in Mobil stock a s ethos is gaining
Some share credit with the plant s management for the efficiency measures they agree are necessary for true job security
Some take the attitude that every company is always for sale
They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it said Sam Salim one of the electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain
But if they fork out billion I d look it over With most Mobil executives saying as little as possible for now calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a peep
Union leaders however are already squawking
I don t believe creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry said Robert Wages a former refinery operator himself and now the union s president by telephone Saturday
Nevertheless with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last November s three year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have to keep to its terms
Many members who typically came to work after high school are already molding the oil companies latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious MBA s
They re the biggest said Bobby Whisneant an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units referring to Exxon
He was coming early on Sunday morning through a plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self service station
So they go buy the second biggest
That s one way to get rid of the competition
I just hope it s not something like the s buying companies and scrapping them Or something like the Robber Baron era a century before said Mabry another operator
Didn t the teachers teach us all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back Remember that he said looking to his friend Lewis the Big E for agreement
But I better shut up
I still work for Mobil Used to Lewis said
Exxon Corp
and Mobil Corp
have held discussions about combining their business operations a person involved in the talks said Wednesday
It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing
If the companies were to merge it would create the largest US company in terms of revenue
A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News
The reported talks between Exxon whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal Mart and General Electric and Mobil the No
US oil company come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost years
A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch Shell Group the world s largest oil company by revenue
Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday
Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment
Any union would reunite two parts of John D
Rockefeller s Standard Oil Trust which was broken up by the Supreme Court in 
Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil consisted of two companies Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil
Both Exxon which has a market value of billion and Mobil which has a market value of billion have a history of being fiercely independence
Both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods when oil prices are low
But this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon
Consequently chief executives of most oil companies have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners
This summer British Petroleum announced a billion agreement to buy Amoco Corp creating the world s third largest oil company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation
It showed that megamergers are doable said Adam Sieminski an analyst for BT Alex
Brown
He added however that a combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge
Exxon he added is a well run company that likes to grow its own businesses He added that the heads of both companies Lee Raymond the chairman of Exxon which is based in Irving Texas and Lucio Noto the chairman president and chief executive of Mobil which is based in Fairfax Va are different personalities
It will not be easy he said of combining the two far flung companies which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United States and Europe
If you offer enough money you can make anything happen he added
Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term
Like other oil companies they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia
Even though they were prepared to spend billions they have held back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian officials and oil companies to give up control of vast fields
Thus they have had to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa
Such exploration is very expensive and even when large fields are found it often takes platforms costing billion to bring the oil into production
Oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year falling more than percent from the a barrel level because of growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there
On Wednesday crude oil for January delivery fell cents or percent to a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange close to the year low of reached on June 
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil producing nations notably Mexico have tried to stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production
But those pledges have not always been honored and rallies in the oil market this year have proven short lived
OPEC members on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday
In the spring OPEC agreed to reduce production by million barrels a day about percent of the daily world supply of million barrels
The main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil prices from falling below a barrel
Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon Mobil discussions
The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum s pending purchase of Amoco
An Exxon Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months worth of scrutiny by the commission which would review how much of the industry such a merger would control
Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of the possible merger
Some pointed to difficulties that the companies could face if they were combined
If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger the answer is probably no said Garfield Miller president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp a small independent investment bank based in New York
It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to gain In particular Miller said the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses
They really do overlap quite a bit he said
You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy Another investment banker in the energy business speaking on the condition of anonymity also questioned the rationale for the discussed merger
When you look at the BP Amoco deal you can rationalize it the banker said
But none of those reasons apply to an Exxon Mobil deal But Amy Jaffe an energy research analyst with the James A
Baker III Institute for Public Policy said the combination of the two companies would be logical in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for projects in Middle Eastern countries
This is a deal that makes sense Ms
Jaffe said
With this combined company there is no project that would be too big In addition Ms
Jaffe said the merger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas of the world where they had little influence
There are a lot of complimentary assets where they are not redundant she said
She said that Exxon for example has a strong presence in Angola while Mobil does not
And Mobil has significant assets in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria where Exxon is weak

Times are tough in the oil patch
Still it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do or at least to consider the prospect as Exxon and Mobil are doing

Philip Verleger Jr publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group a Cambridge Mass consulting firm spent some time late last week talking about Mobil Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business
Following are excerpts from the conversation Q
There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon Mobil deal
Do you see any problems A
Let me say right off that I don t think this is a done deal
I think it is far from that
But if it were to happen I don t see many problems
BP Amoco is the perfect end to end merger one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with
Exxon Mobil comes close
The first issue is competition in local markets
The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast but both companies are pretty small players there
If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration s or the European Union s positions on global warming
Q
Why are you skeptical about the deal A
Well Mobil has been trying to get bigger
They had talks with Amoco
They wanted to buy Conoco
But I don t understand where Lucio Noto Mobil s chief executive fits into this
That could be an impediment to an agreement because in a merger I don t think he has a place and he has been a very strong leader
Q
Mobil is the country s second biggest oil company behind Exxon
Why do they need to get bigger A
In the first decade of the next century the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game Royal Dutch Exxon and BP Amoco
Companies of Mobil s size are probably marginal players
Q
That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices
A
From to Exxon s exploration and production expenditures rose percent
Mobil s rose percent
But Mobil s expenditures were much more sensitive to the price elasticities of oil than Exxon s
They were pushing the envelope and when prices fell they had to cut back
Exxon has tried to build a very large presence systematically without paying much attention to month to month or even year to year fluctuations in oil prices
They are brutally efficient
Q
Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade
Do you agree A
You know every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil companies
I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year
It is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at a barrel depending on what happens to the world economy
During that period we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non OPEC countries
That will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries
And when the Asian economies start growing again that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices say a barrel in the next months
Q
The number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years regardless isn t it A
We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies possibly eight
There is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society
Q
Do you think oil stocks are a good investment A
I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next to months
And it is an area where investors need to be careful because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies
Times are tough in the oil patch
Still it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do or at least to consider the prospect as Exxon and Mobil are doing
Still Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration
Given the exotic locales of the most promising untapped fields it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper
And with West Texas crude trading at around a barrel it seems a safe bet oil that won t be selling for a barrel by the turn of the century a price some analysts in the early s were predicting it would reach

The boards of Exxon Corp
and Mobil Corp
are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world s largest oil company a source close to the negotiations said Friday
The source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the prospects were good for completing an agreement
Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways to combine
They cautioned however that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance they would reach one
The statement sent the stock of both companies surging suggesting investors believe the companies will combine
Shares of Exxon the biggest US oil company rose or percent to Shares of Mobil the No
US oil company rose or percent to 
Some analysts said that if the two giants reached an agreement it was likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil
Exxon is far larger and financially stronger
Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies which employ people
Adam Sieminski an oil analyst for BT Alex
Brown said that the companies would probably make cuts to save about billion to billion a year
Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about to percent over its price prior to Monday when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares up sharply
They said the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares
Based on Mobil s share price a week ago a takeover of the company would be worth about billion
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto the chairman president and chief executive of Mobil to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices
This is one of the most intelligent chief executives in the business and a man of considerable ability but he inherited some serious structural problems in his company said J
Robin West the chairman of Petroleum Finance Co a consulting group to the energy industry based in Washington
He said that Mobil s prime assets include the Arun natural gas field in Indonesia one of the largest in the world which has contributed up to one third of Mobil s profits for years but is beginning to run down
The field in production since supplies liquefied natural gas to Japan and Korea
Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly to cut costs and muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan where it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field the payoff from such ventures is many years away
Other companies face similar strains
The challenge is to replace their crown jewels and grow in an increasingly competitive environment West said
Noto has not been shy about sitting down with other companies such as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination made sense
Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a much stronger and bigger company than Mobil he has not been immune to the strains on the global petroleum business
Those strains intensified this year when Russia s economic collapse raised the risks of Exxon s extensive exploration venture in that country
Exxon has also been more of a follower than a leader in huge projects in the deep offshore fields where major finds have been made near West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico
